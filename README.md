# Calculator
A next generation calculator for complex mathematical calculations. It has many features as:

* **Variable Declaration**: You can declare your own variable as
<code><pre>
x = 3+4
y = x*x
</pre></code>
will output as `49.0`

* **Built-in Functions**: There are many built-in functions for complex calculaions like:

    * `abs(Number)`: Returns the absoulute value. For example `abs(-4.0)` retunrs 4.0.

    * Trignometric functions as `sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec`.

    * `sqr(Number)` for squaring the number and `sqrt(Number)` for square roots.

    * `cube(Number)` for cubing the number and `cbrt` for cube roots.
